        A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul,
        like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole
        heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
        which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.

            What is design? To me it is a process with many
            steps. Visually assisted with an egg. Enjoy.

        I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
        sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I
        should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present
        moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than
        now.
    </p>
    <p>
        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and
        the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
        foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the
        inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the
        trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
        unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
        little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the
        countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
        feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image,
        and the breath.
    </p>
