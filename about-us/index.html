            <p><strong>We love games. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>We love to play games, to develop them, to make games better</strong></p>
            <p>For many years in the game industry, each of us has accumulated a lot of ideas, which were unfeasible. <em>Too risky</em>, told us our former bosses. <em>It is impossible to calculate the efficiency</em>, have we heard. And so one day, we decided to create our own studio. where we can make games exactly as we see them.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The company was founded in 2015 by a group of industry veterans. Armor5Games is committed to an environment free of office politics under the belief that in the games industry, it should be fun to come to work and rewarding to be a part of a great team.</p>
